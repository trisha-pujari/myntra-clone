I have developed a basic Myntra website clone using HTML and CSS, replicating the core layout and functionality of the original site. The project features a fully functional header that includes navigation links to different sections (Men, Women, and Contact Us), along with a search bar. There are also icons for user interactions such as Profile, Wishlist, and Bag.

The main content area showcases a banner image followed by product categories, allowing users to explore different sections of the website. Additionally, a footer is included, offering links to essential resources like customer policies, FAQs, Terms and Conditions, and other useful information.

The "Shop by Category" section contains clickable images, which lead users to specific product categories. Each image represents a different category, such as decor, footwear, ethnic wear, and bags. By clicking on any of these images, users are redirected to their respective category pages for browsing related products. To ensure proper functionality, the images need to be correctly placed in the file paths specified in the code.  
This project is a simple front-end design, demonstrating how a retail e-commerce platform like Myntra can be structured.
