I have developed a clone of the Myntra website using HTML and CSS. The project includes a header with navigation links to sections like Men, Women, and Contact Us, along with a search bar and user action icons such as Profile, Wishlist, and Bag. The main content area features a banner image and clickable product categories for easy browsing.

The footer contains links to customer policies and useful resources, including FAQs and Terms of Use. This project replicates the core layout of an e-commerce platform similar to Myntra.
